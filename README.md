👋 Hi, I'm Vahid Moradi (@vhdmoradi)

👀 I'm passionate about Python and programming. With a strong foundation in Python and a focus on continuous learning, I'm always eager to explore new technologies and expand my skill set.

🌱 I have hands-on experience in various technologies and frameworks, including Python, Django Rest Framework (DRF), Docker, Celery, RabbitMQ, PostgreSQL, pandas, numpy, pandas-ta, and ta-ib. I had the opportunity to work on a dynamic filters project for creating trade strategies, where I utilized these tools to develop robust solutions. Additionally, I developed over 100 trade indicators using Python and pandas, and implemented efficient Python scripts to handle large datasets. Integration of RabbitMQ with Celery allowed me to effectively manage high volumes of I/O and process tasks. I also leveraged Docker to implement a micro-service architecture, simplifying project setup and dependency management.

💞️ I'm excited to be part of this community and eager to collaborate and learn from fellow developers. If you're interested in discussing Python, Django, or any related projects, feel free to reach out to me at vahid.moradi001@gmail.com.

You're welcome to explore my projects and connect with me! Let's continue to grow and excel in the world of Python development together.
